This directory contains various files and scripts associated with analysing 
historical data from the Reverse Beacon Network ("RBN").

compare-sigs:
  Compare the signals between two stations over a given time period, on a 
  particular band and to a particular continent. Provides an estimate 
  of the difference between the means of the underlying signal 
  distributions, the 95% confidence limits of that estimate, and
  the probability that one signal really is stronger than the other. 
  
compare-sigs.py: 
  Used by compare-sigs. Scans the local RBN database and extracts the 
  details of comparison reports, then outputs a list of the SNR differences 
  for use by compare-sigs.R.

compare-sigs.R
  Takes output from compare-sigs.py and plots it as a simple histogram. 
  Also includes a calculation of the best estimate of the true difference 
  in signal between the two compared stations given the input sample, and 
  the 95% confidence limits of the estimate, if there are sufficient data.

convert-rbn:
  Convert RBN data from the as-is format in the RBN zip files to the 
  single-file CSV format used by these scripts.
  
download-rbn:
  Download daily historical files from the RBN as-is, putting the data into 
  files with friendly names.

get-rbn:
  Bring local database (rbndata.csv) up to date.
  
rank-sig:
  Compare the signal of a station to the signals of others on the same 
  continent over a given time period, on a particular band and to a 
  particular continent.

rank-sig.py:
  Used by rank-sig. Scans the local RBN database and provides as output a 
  file that contains the following space-separated information over a given 
  time period in each line:    
    Epoch  target-stn-SNR  all-other-SNRs
  all-other-SNRs are the SNRs for all stations on the same continent as the 
  target, as heard near to the epoch time by stations that have heard the 
  target station.
